# vz + virtiofs stay: they are what make the bind mount fast enough to work in.
# --mount-inotify does NOT. That daemon delivers a host save to the guest by
# chmod'ing the matching guest file, and a chmod is a metadata write that
# propagates straight back out to macOS, where it looks like another host
# change. Paired with any host-side bridge doing the same trick with contents,
# the two sustain an event storm with nobody typing — measured, in the setup
# this starter is generalized from, at 34 inotify events in a 15s window on a
# file nobody had touched.
#
# mac-save-bridge.mjs manufactures that event instead, from INSIDE the guest,
# where the rewrite cannot propagate back out to macOS and restart the cycle.
# See mac-save-bridge.mjs for why polling there beats a framework poll option.
