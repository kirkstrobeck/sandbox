# Decide which model the inner MANAGER runs. Source, don't run. Expects
# SANDBOX_DIR (common.sh sets it) when reading host config files.
#
# The inner agent is the same PRODUCT as the outer one (agent.sh). It is
# deliberately NOT the same model. What dispatch launches inside the container
# is a manager: it writes a short spec, spawns a cheaper worker to do the edits
# and the tests, reviews what came back, and accepts or retries. So the model
# chosen here has to be good enough to route and review, and nothing more —
# the per-task work is not billed at this tier.
#
# Copying the outer client's model, which this file used to do, is the wrong
# answer for that job in both directions. An outer agent on a small fast model
# would hand the container a manager that cannot review; an outer agent on the
# flagship would bill every routing decision at flagship rates. The outer model
# is now ignored on purpose.
#
# WHERE THE ANSWER COMES FROM, in order:
#
#   1. SANDBOX_MODEL         — `./sandbox -m`. Explicit, wins over everything.
#   2. <agent>_manager= from the daily snapshot (model-daily.sh), when that
#      line is non-empty. This is the hook for a promo or a plan change.
#   3. SANDBOX_DEFAULT_MODEL — a project-wide manager pin in sandbox.conf.
#   4. A high-value default per agent — see the table below.
#   5. Empty, and no --model flag is passed. Only reachable for an agent this
#      file has never heard of.
#
# Step 4 is the one that changed. Passing nothing used to be the honest answer
# because nothing readable said what the outer model was; now the harness has an
# opinion about what the manager needs to be, and a CLI default that happens to
# be a cheap chat tier would quietly make the manager the weakest part of the
# run. These ids are handed through verbatim, so they have to be ones the chosen
# agent understands — when one goes stale, this is the single line to change.
